# Cricket Scores
Cricket Scores app for Shaastra Mobile App coordinator application (Question 4)

The app functions as a way to display the information about cricket matches in a concise manner. Details about the matches can be obtained by clicking on them. Matches can either be ongoing or completed. Since details were not given as to where the details are obtained from, some sample matches are hardcoded and prepared in the app. I have also assumed that the source of the data can be easily parsed into the Strings which I have used in my class.
